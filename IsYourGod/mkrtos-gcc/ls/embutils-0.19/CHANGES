0.14:
  add uuencode, uudecode, nohup and nice (from Andreas Krennmair)
  Andreas also fixed a bug in contrib/kill
  Olaf: Fixed a BUG in tail.
  Do some more size improvements (use diet libc __write1 and __write2
    and move uname to using bits instead of ints for each flag.
  Andreas also sent me a cmp implementation.
  Alexandre Karev found and fixed a bug in tr regarding octal escapes.

0.13:
  Andreas Krennmair contributed a uniq (it's a little on the large side
    because it uses malloc to work with long lines)
  Olaf Dreesen contributed tr and dd.
  Also added the other kill in contrib.  I feel bad just throwing it
    away just because Olaf's was smaller ;)
  Olaf Dreesen contributed touch.
  Andreas also contributed mesg and write
  Olaf Dreesen contributed du.
  Fixed ls -l so it does not dump core if readlink fails.
  Olaf Dreesen contributed tail.

0.12:
  add sleep2 (like sleep, but can do "sleep 20:15").  By Frank Klemm.
  optimize echo (<1024 bytes on x86 now, thanks to Frank Klemm).
  rm no longer asks when the superuser deletes files not owned by him.
  "mv foo/ bar" would rename("foo","bar/oo").
  add allinone, which uses the busybox concept to decide by argv[0]
    what to do.  Supports: arch, basename, clear, chvt, dirname, dmesg,
    domainname, echo, env, false, hostname, pwd, sleep, sync, tee, true,
    tty, uname, which, whoami, yes.  By Frank Klemm.  8k.
  Two kills were contributed.  I took the smaller one.
  install will no longer assume -D.
  install will no longer use the given mode for the intermediate
    directories created by -D.

0.11:
  ls -p or -F qualifiers were colored.
  "mv foo/a/ foo/b/ ." did not work.
  added whoami.
  implemented -h in chown.
  ls -l displayed the gid as uid.
  added mkfifo as argv[0] variant of mknod
  added head.
  added install.
  added soscp, sosmv and sosrm, as suggested by Frank Klemm.
  added sosln, soslns (for ln -s).
  added md5sum (without -c).

0.10.1:
  fix ls formatting bug when size was wider than 8 characters.

0.10:
  added cat.
  added rm.
  added wc.
  fix includes to cleanly compile with diet libc includes (and no glibc
    fall-back)
  added ls (a color ls even!).
  added embfeatures.h to not compile in unneeded features.

0.9:
  added -v to ln.
  added mv and cp in one binary (argv[0] decides).
  added yes.
  added which.
  repaired wrong exit codes.
  fixed uname (it always wrote a trailing space, confusing config.guess)

0.8:
  changed printf to libowfat routines in df: 5.2k -> 1.7k.
  same in id: 8k -> 5k.
  same in tar: 15k -> 13k.
  tar: when uname or gname are "", print uid or gid instead.

0.7:
  added ln.
  clarified license to be GPLv2.

0.6:
  imported fixes for df and dmesg from Jens Laas.  Thanks, Jens!
  implemented dmesg -n.
  added "ustar" magic comparison to tar.
  the size display of tar was broken.

0.5.1:
  added dirname, env, domainname, id (no supplementary groups for
    "id ftp" type usage yet)

0.5:
  added "U" (unlink first) to tar.  Thanks to Jens Laas for the contribution!
  added basename, chvt, df (not complete yet), tee, uname, arch, hostname

0.4:
  added sleep, tty, tar (well, almost.  It can do "t" and "x" with
    verbosity and supports "z" for gzip and "I" for bzip2).

0.3:
  oops, chown was broken.  One of my late-night optimizations broke
    getpwnam.  I detected it when I tested my other late-night
    optimizations in diet libc ;-)

0.2:
  added chown, chgrp, chmod
  ugh, directory traversal is a lot of code.
  I reused a lot of code by writing "openreadclose" and "split" which
    others might find useful for their own projects.
  I decided to implement small custom parsers for /etc/passwd and
    /etc/group, based on openreadclose and split, so I can add some
    defines to not include filling in parts of struct passwd and struct
    group that I don't use after that.  chown is still >7k on x86-linux.
    I am depressed about this.
  chgrp is actually a link to chown, argv[0] decides.

0.1:
  initial release.
  chroot clear echo false mkdir mknod pwd rmdir sync true
