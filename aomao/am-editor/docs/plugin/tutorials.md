# Basic

In addition to the plug-in tutorial, you can first have an understanding of the plug-in, read it in `Document` -> `Basic` -> `Plugin`

All plug-ins must inherit one of the plug-in abstract classes and implement it. We can choose a type of plug-in abstract class to inherit according to its purpose. Let's understand them one by one

## Inheritance

Inherit the `Plugin` abstract class

```ts
import {Plugin} from'@aomao/engine'

export default class extends Plugin {
...
}
```

## Attributes

### `pluginName`

Plug-in name, read-only static property

Type: `string`

The plug-in name is unique and cannot be repeated with all plug-in names passed in to the engine

```ts
export default class extends Plugin {
	//Define the plug-in name, it is required
	static get pluginName() {
		return 'plugin name';
	}
}
```

### `options`

Plug-in options

Type: `T extends PluginOptions = {}` The default is an empty object

We can pass in an option to the plug-in, for example: shortcut key

```ts
//Define the optional type
export type Options = {
hotkey?: string | Array<string>;
};

export default class extends Plugin<Options> {
...

init() {
        //Print the incoming optional hotkey
console.log(this.options.hotkey)
}
}
```

When instantiating the engine, pass in the options of the plugin through the `config` attribute

```ts
//Instantiate the engine
const engine = new Engine(render node, {
config: {
Plug-in name: {
hotkey:'test',
},
},
});
```

### `editor`

Editor example

Type: `EditorInterface`

When the plug-in is instantiated, the editor instance will be passed in. We can access it through `this`

```ts
import {Plugin, isEngine} from'@aomao/engine'

export default class extends Plugin<Options> {
...

init() {
console.log(isEngine(this.editor)? "Engine": "Reader")
}
}
```

We can use `isEngine` to determine whether the currently instantiated editor is an engine or a reader

## Method

### `init`

Executed when the plugin is initialized, we can bind some events or initialize some variables here

```ts
...
init(){
    if (isEngine(this.editor)) {
        this.editor.on('keydown:enter', event => () => {
            console.log("Enter key was pressed")
        });
    }
}
...
```

### `queryState`

Status query, optional

This method will be called by `editor.command.queryState`. Mainly used to query whether the current cursor selection area has the node of the current plug-in selected, and then cooperate with the toolbar to display the active or disabled state of the plug-in

You can also customize any other query, call it through `editor.command.queryState`, and pass back parameters to return any data you want to return

```ts
/**
* Query plug-in status
* @param args parameters required by the plug-in
*/
queryState?(...args: any): any;
/**
```

### `execute`

Plug-in execution method, this is an abstract method, it must be implemented

This method will be called by `editor.command.execute`

```ts
...
execute(message: string) {
    console.log(`Hi, ${message}`)
}
...
```

Called by `editor.command.execute`

```ts
editor.command.execute('plugin name', 'xiaoming');
//Output Hi, Xiao Ming
```

### `hotkey`

Plug-in hot key binding, optional.

This returns the key combination characters that need to be matched, such as mod+b. If the match is successful, the plug-in will be executed. You can also bring the parameters required for the plug-in execution. Multiple parameters are returned in the form of an array {key:"mod+b",args:[ ]}

`mod` means the `ctrl` key under windows, and the `command` (âŒ˜) key under mac

We use [is-hotkey](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/is-hotkey) to match whether the hotkey is hit or not. For more usage methods, please go to [is-hotkey](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/is-hotkey) view

We can also directly use isHotkey to determine whether it is hit

```ts
import {isHotkey, Plugin} from'@aomao/engine'

//Define the optional type
export type Options = {
hotkey?: string | Array<string>;
};

export default class extends Plugin<Options> {
...
hotkey(event?: KeyboardEvent) {
        //Use hotkey to judge
        return event && isHotkey(event, this.options.hotkey ||'')
        //Or directly return to the shortcut keys for optional configuration
return this.options.hotkey ||'';
        //You can also return to multiple sets of shortcut keys
        return ["mod+a","mod+b"]
}
}
```

Method signature

```ts
hotkey?(event?: KeyboardEvent,): string | {key: string; args: any} | Array<{ key: string; args: any }> | Array<string>;
```

After the hotkey is hit, it will execute the call `editor.command.execute` command to execute the plug-in, and the parameters will also be carried

### `waiting`

Wait for the plugin to complete certain actions, optional

When using asynchronously to get the editor value `engine.getValueAsync`, if the plug-in operation has not been completed, it will wait for the plug-in to complete the action before returning the value. For example, the image is being uploaded

```ts
async waiting?(): Promise<void>;
```

### `Complete example`

```ts
import { Plugin } from '@aomao/engine';

export type Options = {
	hotkey?: string | Array<string>;
};

export default class extends Plugin {
	static get pluginName() {
		return 'plugin name';
	}

	init() {
		console.log(isEngine(this.editor) ? 'Engine' : 'Reader');
	}

	execute(message: string) {
		console.log(`Hi, ${message}`);
	}

	hotkey() {
		return this.options.hotkey || '';
	}
}
```
