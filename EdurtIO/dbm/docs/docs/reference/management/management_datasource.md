In the first step, we need to select the type of data source. We click the `ClickHouse` icon to select the data source, and click `Next` to configure the parameters.

##### DataSource Configuration

![Configuration](../../assets/images/others/management/datasource/configuration.png)

It has two types of datasource parametersï¼š

###### Basic Settings

- `Alias`: This field is only used to mark the alias of the current property. The default `localhost` is easy to remember and has no special meaning.
- `Protocol`: Connection service protocol, default `http`
- `Host`: Enter the hostname or IP address of the remote server here, the default is `localhost`
- `Port`: Enter the host address of the remote server here, corresponding to the open port, the default is `8123`
- `User Name`: Connection service user name, input when setting, default `default`
- `Password`: Connection service user password, if set, please enter

###### Experimental Settings

!!! note "Warning"

    This configuration may be unstable, but it will not cause software errors, only some functions will not take effect, and will continue to be converted to official functions in the future

- `MaxTotal`: Maximum number of data query rows

---

When we fill in the basic configuration, click the `Test` button at the bottom, and the `OK` button can be clicked after the test is passed.

After clicking the `OK` button, we will save the configuration information you wrote for the next time

Configuration information can be saved in two states

- `Stop`: A stopped state, meaning the service is currently unavailable, marked with a stop icon
- `Start`: Available status, indicating that the service is currently available for operations such as query, and is marked with a play icon

!!! note

    We do not allow saving of untested services, please make sure it is available to save again.

After the configuration is saved successfully, the pop-up box will be closed and the list of data just saved will be displayed on the page

There are two buttons at the top of the list

    This operation will traverse all data sources to request to verify the availability of data sources
