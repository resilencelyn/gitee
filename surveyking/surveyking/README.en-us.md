## Background

Based on Ali's open source [formily](https://github.com/alibaba/formily) form solution self-developed survey editor, using the latest front-end and back-end technology (React+SpringBoot+AntDesignUI) to build a complete survey system.

SurveyKing is one of the known open source survey systems that has **the most powerful functions**, **the simplest installation**, and **the best comprehensive experience**.

**Simple**, **Easy to use**, and **Professional** are the continuous development concepts of SurveyKing. Large and medium-sized enterprises and even individuals can use SurveyKing to quickly build their own online survey system.

## 🚀 Quickly build a questionnaire system in 1 minute

1. First [install Java runtime environment](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) (if the machine already has a Java environment, you can ignore it)
2. Download [Volume King Installation Package](https://github.com/javahuang/SurveyKing/releases/download/v0.2.0/surveyking-h2-v0.2.0.jar)
3. Double-click to run
4. Open the browser to visit <http://localhost:1991>, enter the account password: *admin*/*surveyking*

## Install

### Install via distribution

Currently adapted to h2 database and mysql database

Click [Download surveyking-h2 version](https://github.com/javahuang/SurveyKing/releases/download/v0.2.0/surveyking-h2-v0.2.0.jar) to the local

Click [Download surveyking-mysql version](https://github.com/javahuang/SurveyKing/releases/download/v0.2.0/surveyking-mysql-v0.2.0.jar) to the local

### Use source code to compile and install

The h2 version of the installation package is built by default.

```bash
# Download source code
git clone https://github.com/javahuang/SurveyKing.git

# Start building
gradle clean :api:build -P pro -x test

# start operation
java -jar api/build/libs/surveyking-v0.1.0.jar
```

### Quick start with docker

When you start the SurveyKing mirroring, you can specify the SurveyKing mount parameters and save the log files and built-in database to your local. (There are still some problems with the docker version, to be resolved)

```bash
docker run -p 1991:1991 surveyking/surveyking
# Mount data file
docker run -p 1991:1991 -v /surveyking:/surveyking surveyking/surveyking
```

## Usage

Since this system is built in Java, it needs to rely on the Java runtime environment, which can be downloaded via [Java download for all operating systems
](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) to pre-install the java environment.

Follow the instructions below to configure different databases. If the front-end needs to be deployed with nginx, refer to using nginx to deploy the front-end.

Windows and mac support double-click to run, or open a command line window to execute the following commands

```bash
java -jar surveyking-v0.1.0.jar
```

Open the browser and visit <http://localhost:1991>. After the system is started for the first time, the admin user, account/password (*admin/surveyking*) will be created automatically, and the password can be changed through the user management interface after logging in to the system.

### h2 startup method

Without any configuration, the database startup script will be created automatically. If you need to change the port number, refer to the defined port of mysql startup mode.

### mysql startup mode

1. First create the mysql database, and then execute the initialization script, [download script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javahuang/SurveyKing/master/rdbms/src/main/resources/scripts/init-mysql.sql).
2. Then create a new `application.properties` file under the current directory.

  ```properties
  server.port=1991 # Port number (optional, default 1991)
  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://<ip>:<port>/<dbname> # Database connection address, replace with your mysql database address
  spring.datasource.username=username # Database account (required)
  spring.datasource.password=password # database password (required)
  ```

### Deploy the front-end with nginx

Download [static resource files under this directory](https://github.com/javahuang/SurveyKing/tree/master/api/src/main/resources/static) and deploy directly to nginx.

Then configure the proxy to proxy to the back-end api service.

## Online experience

Demo address: <https://surveyking.cn>

Click *Try it*, no need to register and log in (-_-||, the server bandwidth is only 1M, maybe the first load is slightly slower)
