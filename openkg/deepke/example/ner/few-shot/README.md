## Requirements

> python == 3.8

- torch == 1.5
- transformers == 3.4.0
- deepke

## Download Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE.git
cd DeepKE/example/ner/few-shot
```

## Install with Pip

- Create and enter the python virtual environment.
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Train and Predict

- Dataset

  - Download the dataset to this directory.

    ```bash
    wget 120.27.214.45/Data/ner/few-shot/data.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf data.tar.gz
    ```

  - The datasets are stored in `data`, including CoNLL-2003, MIT-movie, MIT-restaurant and ATIS.
    
  - **CoNLL-2003**
    
    - `train.txt`: Training set
    - `valid.txt `: Validation set
    - `test.txt`: Test set
    - `indomain-train.txt`: In-domain training set

  - **MIT-movie, MIT-restaurant and ATIS**
    - `k-shot-train.txt`: k=[10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500], Training set
    - `test.txt`: Testing set

- Training

  - Parameters, model paths and configuration for training are in the `conf` folder and users can modify them before training.

  - Training on CoNLL-2003

    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

  - Few-shot Training

    If the model need to be uploaded, modify `load_path` in `few_shot.yaml`

    ```bash
    python run.py +train=few_shot
    ```

  - Logs for training are in the `log` folder. The path of the trained model can be customized.

- Prediction

  - Add `- predict` in `config.yaml`

  - Modify `load_path` as the path of the trained model and `write_path` as the path of predicted results in `predict.yaml` 

  - ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```
